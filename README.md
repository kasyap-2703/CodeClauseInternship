# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Unique Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a unique twist! This version is copyright-free and open-source.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file using Python.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns playing against the AI.
4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins!
5. If the board fills up without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

## Features

- Play against an AI opponent that makes random moves.
- Input validation to ensure valid moves from the player.
- Visually appealing board display.
- Unique and copyright-free implementation.

You can run the game by executing the `tic_tac_toe.py` file. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.



# Object Detection System

## Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a system that can detect and classify objects in images or video streams.

## Description

This project involves creating an object detection model capable of identifying and locating multiple objects within an image or video. We will utilize a pre-trained model such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN and customize it to detect specific objects of interest.

## Technologies

- Python
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- OpenCV
- (Optional) Other technologies that you may prefer or have expertise in.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.).
3. Download the pre-trained model weights and configuration files (if applicable).
4. Run the object detection script, passing the image or video stream as input.
5. View the output with detected objects highlighted or labeled.
